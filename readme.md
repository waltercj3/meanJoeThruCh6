This is my implementation of the Loc8r app described in Getting MEAN by Simon Holmes.  
This version is complete through chapter 7.  As the use of AngularJS starts in chapter 8, perhaps we can say this version is using the MEN stack.  
This project was part of a Web Development class at Linn-Benton Community College taught by Joe Paris.
